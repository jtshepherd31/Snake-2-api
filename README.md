## Welcome to Snake 2.0!

This page allows you to play the game 'snake'
Newer versions will allow you to add more difficulty with multiple levels with more obstacles within the game area aside from yourself and the walls.


### User Stories

As a competitive user, I want to see my high scores so I can see how much better I am getting each session.

As a laidback user, I want a simple game so that I can have a mindless time waster when I am bored.

As a visual user, I want an interactive design so that I can enjoy the game visually.

As an older user, I want the game page to be easy to navigate so that I can play easier.

### Future iterations -

I would like to add barricades within the game borders for an extra challenge for the user. Eventually would like to have multiple levels with different barricade configurations to change the dynamics of the typical game of "snake". I would also like to add local and global leaderboards to show highscores for all users and each individual user.


### Planning, process, and problem-solving strategy

-- Used personal standups to plan my workday and see what all was achievable within my planned schedule and then a quick overview of my days work to see what was missed or what was completed outside of my schedule for the day. For problem solving, I put issue tickets in if I was stuck and then started to work on something else to be as efficient as possible. For most of my bugs, I was able to resolve them by using the debugger and documentation when I was unsure if I had correct syntax.
