### Future iterations -

I would like to add barricades within the game borders for an extra challenge for the user. Eventually would like to have multiple levels with different barricade configurations to change the dynamics of the typical game of "snake". I would also like to add local and global leaderboards to show highscores for all users and each individual user.
